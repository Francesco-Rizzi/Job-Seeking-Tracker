### Tech stuff 👾:
I build this web app from scratch, the backend is mainly a LAMP based stack which provides APIs for storing and retrieving data as well as registering and authenticating users (JWT auth).

The frontend is a SPA (Single-Page-App) based on React and Redux.

The compilation and bundling of the JS stuff is done with Webpack, creating two bundles for Custom end Vendor code along with using name hashing for cache management.
